Installation Guide
==================

.. TODO: add pyns-python3 to installation for complete install.

Through pyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^

eba-toolkit is coming soon to pyPI.
..  The simplest way to install eba-toolkit is through pyPI, which is often automatically installed with python. To install eba-toolkit,
open a terminal window such as bash, powershell, or cmd.exe. Run the command 'pip install eba-toolkit' or 'pip3 install eba-toolkit' to automatically
download and install eba-toolkit along with all the dependencies.

.. It is not recommended to install eba-toolkit in the base python environment because pyPI may interfere with other packages.
Instead, it is recommended to install eba-toolkit in a fresh virtual environment. Anaconda and the python package venv
provide ways to manage virtual environments. For more information, see https://www.anaconda.com/ and https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html.

Through GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view the source code on GitHub as well as examples in jupyter notebook, go to https://github.com/ludwig-lab/eba-toolkit.
Download the repository into a file folder of your choice. eba-toolkit can also be installed after downloading the source
code by navigating to the eba-toolkit directory in a terminal window, ensuring that the terminal is operating in the correct
virtual environment, and then running 'pip install .' or 'python setup.py install'.

Through a Web Browser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

eba-toolkit is coming soon to binder.
.. To run eba-toolkit in a web browser, go to the github page at https://github.com/ludwig-lab/eba-toolkit, then click
on the Binder link in the ReadMe file. It will take a few minutes to load the environment. After the environment is loaded,
it is now possible to run the example jupyter notebooks in a web browser. A small example data set is provided.
